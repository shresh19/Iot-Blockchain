# IoT-and-Blockchain

A simple IoT and Blockchain based application to demonstrate the use of blockchain in IoT.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Windows 8+ (for simulating GPIO pins on Windows), Raspberry Pi (for using actual GPIO pins)
- [Windows Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) - Only for Windows (Simulating GPIO pins on Windows)

> Note: _Windows Build Tools is required to install web3. Install through Powershell(Admin) if not installed already_

```bash
npm install -g windows-build-tools
```

### Steps

Before starting with app, you need to compile the smart contract and start a local blockchain. Follow the steps below to do so:

1. Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start a local blockchain using Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

3. Compile contract in a separate terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

4. Install python dependencies and start the app:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser to see the app and Interact with the IoT device.
